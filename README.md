# Reverse-Engineered-Product-Landing-Page


Reverse engineered ('https://www.prodirectbasketball.com/basketball-shoes.aspx') to practice html css and javascript , giving me the confidence to build professional websites with good UI/UX design. 

I built this product landing page from scratch , i did this by looking at the layout of the website and then attempting to reverse enginner it. I got fonts and images from inspect - page source, everything else was hand coded by me. 

After making the the design look similar to the website i made some errors such as over using position absolute, not makiing it responsive and was having difficulty with the hover of my last container section. What i did to solve this problem was by using {flex} flexbox with media queries to make the landing page responsive.
